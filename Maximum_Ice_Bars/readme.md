# Problem Statement

The objective of this code is to solve a specific problem related to selecting items for purchase within a given total price. It employs a technique using priority queues to efficiently find the maximum number of items that can be purchased within the total price.

## Approach

The code follows a greedy approach to solve the problem. It maintains a priority queue to keep track of the prices of items available for purchase. The algorithm iteratively selects items from the priority queue until the total price is exhausted.

## Algorithm

1. **Read the number of items available (n).**
2. **Read the prices of the items into a vector (x).**
3. **Read the available total prices.**
4. **Initialize a priority queue to store the prices of items in non-decreasing order.**
5. **Iterate through the items, pushing their prices into the priority queue.**
6. **While the priority queue is not empty and the remaining prices is greater than or equal to the price of the cheapest item:**
    - **Increment the count of purchased items.**
    - **Deduct the price of the purchased item from the remaining total prices.**
    - **Pop the cheapest item from the priority queue.**
7. **Output the count of purchased items.**

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the algorithm depends on the number of items (n). Inserting items into the priority queue takes O(n log n) time, and each iteration to purchase an item takes O(log n) time. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n log n).

## Space Complexity

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n) due to the storage of item prices in the vector.

## Other Considerations

- The code assumes non-negative prices for the items.
- It handles cases where the input array is empty or contains only negative numbers.
- The code uses priority queues for efficient selection of items based on price.
- The code does not perform any validation on the input.

## Conclusion

The provided code efficiently solves the problem of selecting items for purchase within a given budget using a greedy approach with priority queues. It has a time complexity of O(n log n) and a space complexity of O(n).
