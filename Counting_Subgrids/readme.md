## Problem Statement
The objective of this code is to calculate the number of subgrids whose all corners are black. It means that the count of pairs of rows in a grid such that the bitwise AND of corresponding elements in the two rows is non-zero.

## Approach
The code follows a bit manipulation approach to count the total number of pairs satisfying the condition. It iterates through each pair of rows and calculates the bitwise AND of corresponding elements in those rows. Then, it counts the set bits in the bitwise AND result and accumulates the count. Finally, it calculates the total count of pairs using the accumulated count.

## Algorithm
1. Read the size of the grid (n).
2. Read the elements into a 2D vector (grid) of size nxn.
3. Initialize variables `sz` to 64, `cnt` to 0, and `total` to 0.
4. Iterate over each pair of rows (i, j) in the grid:
    - Initialize `cnt` to 0.
    - Iterate over each block of `sz` bits in the rows:
        - Iterate over each element in the block:
            - Calculate the bitwise AND of corresponding elements in rows i and j.
            - Count the number of set bits in the bitwise AND result and add to `cnt`.
    - Update `total` by adding `(cnt * (cnt - 1)) / 2`.
5. Output the total count (`total`).

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2 * (n/64)), where n is the size of the grid. Here, n^2 represents the number of pairs of rows, and (n/64) represents the number of blocks of 64 bits in each row.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1) due to the storage of elements in the 2D grid.

## Other Considerations
- The code assumes non-negative integers as input.
- It handles cases where the grid size is empty.

## Conclusion
The provided code efficiently calculates the count of pairs of rows in a grid such that the bitwise AND of corresponding elements in the two rows is non-zero. It has a time complexity of O(n^2 * (n/64)) and a space complexity of O(1).
