## Problem Statement
This code aims to solve a specific problem related to dynamic programming. It employs a technique to find the maximum product subarray within a given array.

## Approach
The code uses dynamic programming to compute the maximum product subarray efficiently. It maintains two DP arrays to keep track of the maximum and minimum product subarrays ending at each index.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize DP arrays to store maximum and minimum product subarrays ending at each index.
2. Iterate through the input array, updating DP arrays based on the current element's sign.
3. Calculate the maximum product by taking the maximum value from the maximum product subarray DP array.
4. Output the maximum product modulo a given value (mod) (i.e 1e9+7).

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the size of the input array. This is because the algorithm iterates through the array only once.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n) as well. This is due to the two DP arrays used to store maximum and minimum product subarrays, each of size n.

## Other Considerations
- The code assumes non-negative integers in the input array.
- It handles cases where the input array is empty or contains only negative numbers.
- The code uses modular arithmetic to prevent integer overflow by taking the result modulo a large prime number.

## Conclusion
The provided code efficiently solves the problem of finding the maximum product subarray using dynamic programming. It has a time and space complexity of O(n) and includes considerations for edge cases and optimization.
