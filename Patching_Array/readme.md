## Problem Statement
The objective of this code is to solve a specific problem related to calculating the count of elements required to make the sum greater than or equal to a given value (k). 

## Approach
The code follows a greedy approach to find the count of elements required to achieve the desired sum. It iterates through the given array and keeps adding elements until the sum is greater than or equal to the given value (k).

## Algorithm
1. Read the number of elements (n).
2. Read the numbers into a vector (num).
3. Read the value of k.
4. Initialize sum = 1 and cnt = 0.
5. Iterate over the elements of the vector until sum becomes greater than or equal to k:
    - If the current element is less than or equal to the remaining required sum (k - sum), add it to the sum and increment the index.
    - If the current element is greater than the remaining required sum, double the sum and increment the count of elements required (cnt).
6. Output the count of elements required (cnt).

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input vector.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1) due to the storage of numbers in the vector.

## Other Considerations
- The code assumes non-negative integers as input.
- It handles cases where the input array is empty.

## Conclusion
The provided code efficiently calculates the count of elements required to make the sum greater than or equal to a given value (k) using a greedy approach. It has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).
