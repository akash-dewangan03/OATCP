## Problem Statement
The objective of this code is to calculate the total count of pairs of integers such that their bitwise AND is non-zero.

## Approach
The code follows a bitwise manipulation approach to count the total number of pairs satisfying the condition. It iterates through each bit position and counts the number of elements having a particular bit set. Then, it calculates the total pairs by multiplying the counts of set and unset bits at each position.

## Algorithm
1. Read the number of elements (n).
2. Read the numbers into a vector (v).
3. Initialize variables `cnt` and `tot` to 0.
4. Iterate from bit position 0 to 31:
    - Initialize `cnt` to 0.
    - Iterate over the elements of the vector:
        - Check if the least significant bit of the current element is set:
            - Increment `cnt`.
        - Right shift the current element by one bit.
    - Update `tot` by adding `(cnt * (n - cnt))`.
5. Output the total count (`tot`).

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n * 32), where n is the number of elements in the input vector. Here, 32 represents the number of bits in an integer.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1) due to the storage of integers in the vector.

## Other Considerations
- The code assumes non-negative integers as input.
- It handles cases where the input array is empty.

## Conclusion
The provided code efficiently calculates the total count of pairs of integers such that their bitwise AND is non-zero. It has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).
