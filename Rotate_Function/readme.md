## Problem Statement
This code aims to solve a problem related to dynamic programming. Specifically, it computes the maximum sum of i * A[i] for a given array A of integers.

## Approach
The code utilizes a dynamic programming approach to find the maximum sum of i * A[i] for a given array A. It computes the sum of i * A[i] for all elements in the array and then iterates through the array to calculate the maximum sum.

## Algorithm
1. Read the size of the array (n) and the array elements.
2. Initialize a dynamic programming array (dp) to store the maximum sum of i * A[i] for each index.
3. If the size of the array is less than or equal to 1, output 0. If it's equal to 2, output the maximum of the two elements and return.
4. Calculate the total sum (vl) and the initial sum considering all elements at their original indices (sm).
5. Initialize dp[0] with sm and set mx to dp[0].
6. Iterate through the array from index 1 to n-1.
   - Update dp[i] by adding the previous dp value and subtracting the contribution of the last element's position.
   - Update mx if dp[i] is greater than mx.
7. Output mx, which represents the maximum sum of i * A[i].

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the size of the input array. This is because the algorithm iterates through the array only once.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n) as well. This is due to the dynamic programming array (dp) used to store intermediate results, with a size equal to the input array.

## Conclusion
The provided code efficiently solves the problem of finding the maximum sum of i * A[i] using dynamic programming. It has a time and space complexity of O(n) and includes considerations for edge cases and optimization.
