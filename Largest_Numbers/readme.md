# Problem Statement

The objective of this code is to solve a specific problem related to arranging given numbers to form the largest possible number. The code employs a sorting technique with custom comparison to achieve this.

## Approach

The code follows a greedy approach to arrange the given numbers in such a way that the resulting number is the largest possible. It converts each number to a string and sorts them based on a custom comparison function.

## Algorithm

1. **Read the number of elements (n).**
2. **Read the numbers into a vector (x).**
3. **Convert each number to a string.**
4. **Sort the strings in non-increasing order based on a custom comparison function.**
5. **Concatenate the sorted strings to form the largest possible number.**
6. **Output the resulting number.**

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the sorting algorithm dominates the overall complexity. The sorting algorithm used here has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of elements.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity of the algorithm depends on the size of the input. It is O(n) due to the storage of numbers in the vector.

## Other Considerations

- The code assumes non-negative numbers in the input.
- It handles cases where the input array is empty.
- The code converts numbers to strings for sorting.
- Custom comparison is used to determine the order of strings during sorting.

## Conclusion

The provided code efficiently arranges the given numbers to form the largest possible number using a sorting technique with custom comparison. It has a time complexity of O(n log n) and a space complexity of O(n).
