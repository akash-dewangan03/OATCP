## Word Short Form Generator

### Introduction
This code generates unique short forms for words based on their substrings. It aims to provide a concise representation for longer words by selecting substrings that are not already assigned to other words.

### Algorithm Overview
1. **Substring Generation**: Generate all possible substrings of length up to 4 for each word in the input.
2. **Short Form Selection**:
   - For each word, iterate through its generated substrings.
   - If a substring is not already assigned to another word, assign it as the short form for the current word.
   - Ensure that the selected short forms are unique across all words.
3. **Output**: Return a mapping of words to their corresponding short forms.

### Code Overview
- The code defines functions for generating substrings and for selecting short forms for words.
- It reads input consisting of a list of words and computes the unique short forms using the provided functions.
- The main function initializes I/O and calls the `solve` function.

### Working
The provided code generates unique short forms for words based on their substrings. Here's how it works:
1. **Substring Generation**: It generates all possible substrings of length up to 4 for each word in the input.
2. **Short Form Selection**:
   - For each word, it iterates through its generated substrings.
   - If a substring is not already assigned to another word, it selects it as the short form for the current word.
   - It ensures that the selected short forms are unique across all words.
3. **Output**: The code returns a mapping of words to their corresponding short forms.

The code utilizes functions and data structures to efficiently compute the short forms. It reads input for the list of words, generates short forms, and outputs the mapping of words to their short forms.

If a unique short form cannot be found for a word, it notifies the user accordingly.
